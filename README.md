- 👋 Hi, I’m @calvin-chung-mox.
- 👀 I’m interested in backend engineering.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Kotlin and how it is integrated with other libraries to create different microservices.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on different code reviews and tasks to let me have a broad understanding of backend engineering.
- 📫 You can just Slack me if you have anything that you want to discuss with me. Any topic is welcome!!!
